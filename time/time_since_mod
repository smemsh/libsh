#
# Returns the time since the file was last modified, in
# minutes.  Intended for giving to find -mmin, possibly like
# this:
#
#     find somedir/					\
#	-mmin -$(($(time_since_mod somefile) + 10))	\
#	-mmin +$(($(time_since_mod somefile) - 10))	\
#
# This would give a 20 second range based around mtime of
# `somefile'.
#
# XXX TODO should return seconds, and have companion
# depending on invocation that can report minutes, hours or
# anything else
