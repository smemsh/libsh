# are not using 'record' at the moment and/or implementation
# is unfinished

# incomplete and may be unnecessary:
# ... | field | field | field
#
# or maybe implement | split delim | field

#function \
#record ()

#	((${#delim} > 1)) && bomb "string delimiters not yet implemented"

#	# We do this bit of trickery instead of just
#	# "while read...do" due to the fact that `read'
#	# returns false on the last record if it does not
#	# have a trailing delimiter, so we miss printing the
#	# last record if we don't do so after a false but
#	# before breaking out of the loop.  See msgids
